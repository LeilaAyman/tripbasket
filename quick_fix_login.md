# Quick Fix for Login Issue with adv@gmail.com

## What I Found

The issue is that when you login with `adv@gmail.com`, several things can go wrong:

1. **Firebase Authentication succeeds** ✅
2. **User document fails to load from Firestore** ❌
3. **App router gets confused about login state** ❌
4. **You get stuck in a loading/redirect loop** ❌

## Quick Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Check Debug Console
After trying to login, check your Flutter debug console for messages like:
- `LOGIN DEBUG: Authentication successful`
- `AUTH STREAM ERROR: Failed to load user document`
- `ROUTER DEBUG: loggedIn = false`

### Solution 2: Manual Database Fix
If the user document doesn't exist in Firestore:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Navigate to the `users` collection
3. Look for a document with the user's UID
4. If it doesn't exist, create it manually with:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "adv@gmail.com",
     "role": ["admin"],
     "created_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
     "uid": "USER_UID_HERE"
   }
   ```

### Solution 3: Firestore Rules Check
Make sure your Firestore rules allow the user to read their own document:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{document} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == document;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == document;
    }
  }
}
```

### Solution 4: Temporary Bypass (Testing Only)
I added a temporary fix to the Agency Dashboard. Try navigating directly to `/agency-dashboard` after login.

## What the Debug Logs Will Show

### If Authentication Works:
```
LOGIN DEBUG: Authentication successful
LOGIN DEBUG: User UID: abc123
LOGIN DEBUG: User Email: adv@gmail.com
```

### If User Document Loads:
```
AUTH STREAM: User document loaded: SUCCESS
AUTH STREAM: User email: adv@gmail.com
AUTH STREAM: User roles: [admin]
```

### If Router Works:
```
ROUTER DEBUG: loggedIn = true
ROUTER DEBUG: Navigating to HomeWidget
```

## Next Steps

1. Try logging in and check the debug console
2. If you see "AUTH STREAM ERROR", the issue is Firestore access
3. If you see "User document loaded: NULL", the document doesn't exist
4. If you see "loggedIn = false", the router isn't recognizing the login

Let me know what debug messages you see and I can provide a more specific fix!
